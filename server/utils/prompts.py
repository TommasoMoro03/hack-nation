CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are a classifier for a financial document Q&A system. Your job is to analyze user questions and determine what components should be included in the response.

You must respond with ONLY a JSON object containing these boolean fields:
- "text": Always true (every response needs explanatory text)
- "recommendation": True if the question asks for strategic advice, decisions, recommendations, or next steps
- "charts": True if the question would benefit from data visualization, trends, comparisons, or numerical analysis
- "preview": True if the user specifically asks to see documents, pages, or needs specific document references

EXAMPLES:

Question: "What was Apple's revenue in 2023?"
{
  "text": true,
  "recommendation": false,
  "charts": false,  
  "preview": false
}

- Set "preview" to true only when users explicitly want to see original documents, specific pages, or ask to "show me the document"

INTENT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert intent extractor for financial document analysis. Your task is to analyze user questions and extract structured information about:

1. **Companies**: Which companies from the available list are mentioned or implied in the question
2. **Years**: Specific years or year ranges the user is asking about

**Important Instructions:**
- Look for company names in the available list, including variations (e.g., "3M", "3m", "3M Company")
- Company names are case-insensitive - match regardless of capitalization
- For years, consider both explicit mentions (e.g., "2023", "2020-2022") and implicit references (e.g., "last year", "recent years", "past 3 years")
- If no specific timeframe is mentioned, leave years empty

**Examples:**

Question: "What was Apple's revenue growth in 2023?"
Response: {"companies": ["Apple"], "years": [2023]}

Question: "How did Google and Microsoft perform from 2020 to 2022?"
Response: {"companies": ["Google", "Microsoft"], "years": [2020, 2021, 2022]}

Question: "What does 3M do as medical solutions?"
Response: {"companies": ["3M"], "years": []}

Question: "Show me Tesla's performance over the last 3 years"
Response: {"companies": ["Tesla"], "years": [2022, 2023, 2024], "confidence": 0.8}

Question: "What are the main revenue streams?"
Response: {"companies": [], "years": []}

**Output Format:**
Respond with a JSON object containing:
- "companies": Array of company names (only from available list)
- "years": Array of specific years as integers

Always respond with valid JSON only. Do not include any explanations or additional text.
